ice Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer.  

## Dependencies

A working installation of Matlab or GNU Octave. Confirmed to run on Matlab R2020b and Octave 7.2.0, but it should run on any recent release, and there should not be any toolbox dependencies.

## Install

Run `Setup.m`. If running in Octave, check `.octaverc`.

## Usage

Run `mcrt_verify.m` to verify model accuracy. There are three simulations that compare model output with van De Hulst's tabulated solutions to the transfer equation. It could easily be modified for a different problem by setting the inherent optical properties and geometry to new values.

The `examples` directory includes code needed to reproduce the detector interference simulations reported in the paper below. If you wanted to investigate the influence of an instrument on optical measurements, that code would be a good place to start (e.g. see `rodintersect.m`).

For general use, there is a library of "inherent optical properties" (scattering and absorption coefficients) for water ice Ih saved in `dat/mie_iops_dE.mat`. The prefix `mie_` refers to the Mie scattering formulas used to compute the scattering coefficients. The suffix `_dE` refers to the "delta Eddington" approximation used to compute the extinction coefficients: $c=\sqrt{3ab_e}$ with extinction coefficient $c$, absorption coefficient $a$, and effective (or 'reduced') scattering coefficient $b_e$. Note that this equation is identical to the diffusion approximation, where $c$ is sometimes called the "propagation coefficient". It's inverse $1/c$ is the "transport length". See `doc/tc-2020-53-supplement.pdf` for more details on how these values enter into the Monte Carlo model. In addition, `dat/ssa_iops_dE.mat` contains the same values of absorption coefficient, but values of scattering and extinction coefficient computed with the "specific surface area" approximation, which is also called the "geometric optics" approximation. This approximation is valid for scatterers about the same size or slightly larger than the interacting wavelengths. The effective particle radii are saved in the libary as well.

## More details

The model roughly implements the one described in Wang et al. (1995). It is not meant to be an exact implementation. The model simulates transfer through a uniform slab. See `doc/tc-2020-53-supplement.pdf` and the two references for technical descriptions.
